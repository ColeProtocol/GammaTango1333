The RAK app is a catch-all application for members of the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, also known as the Rakka-sans, derived from the Japanese word for “parachute”. The app is intended to provide members of the Rakkasans with a single hub for key activities and information around base; its key functionality is to provide easy access to military documents (e.g. onboarding documents), but the full scope of the app includes a wide variety of features, including maps of base, events calendars, messaging, fitness instructions, and more.
