## v0.1.0
### Features
* Changed the view of the RAK fit page to view many different workout categories to browse several workouts in a single glance compared to slowly scrolling through one at a time. 

* Fixed the spacing on the RAK Fit page to have appropriate spacing between each section, so that the page is less crowded and easy to read. 

* Added place holders for different pages and sepparate exercise goals widgets.

### Bug Fixes 
* The RAKFit page was not connected correctly, so the routing to the pages were fixed.
